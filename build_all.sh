NAME
   $EXECUTABLE - Build all the apps by executing their 'bin_sh/build_app' command

SYNOPSIS
   ./$EXECUTABLE [-skipMan] [-coherence] [-?]

   Builds all the apps by executing their 'bin_sh/build_app' command and creates
   the 'all' distribution file that contains the apps that are fully compiled
   and ready to run.

   To include man pages specify the '-man' option. Note that generating man pages 
   may take a few minutes to complete. 

   By default, the Coherence module is not included due to the lack of public Maven
   packages. You must manually install the Coherence package as described
   in the following file before specifying the '-coherence' option to include
   the Coherence module in the build.

   coherence-addon-core/README.md

NOTES
   The man pages are generated using the command usage outputs obtained by executing each
   command with the '-?' option. The '-?' option may output error messages for those commands
   that run Java executables if they are not in the class path. You can ignore the error
   messages and build an incomplete list of man pages or you can set CLASSPATH.

OPTIONS
   -all
             If specified, then builds all modules and generates man pages.

   -man
             If specified, then generate man pages for all modules.

   -coherence
             If specified, then includes the coherence moudle in the build.
             Note that you may need to install Coherence manually in the local 
             Maven repository for this option to work. Please see the follwoing
             file for details.
