NAME
   $EXECUTABLE - Build the perf_test 'factory' environment for the workspace

SYNOPSIS
   $EXECUTABLE [-clean] [-?]
   
DESCRIPTION
   Builds the perf_test 'factory' environment for the workspace. It downloads
   the dependencies and places them in the following app lib directory.

   $APP_DIR/lib
   
NOTES
    Normally, the dependencies are placed in the workspace lib directory but due
    to too many jar conflicts, this app sets the class path to app lib directory
    instead.

OPTIONS
   -clean
             Cleans up the build files after the build completes.

DEFAULT
   ./$EXECUTABLE

   exit

# Remove the build files if the -clean option is specified.
