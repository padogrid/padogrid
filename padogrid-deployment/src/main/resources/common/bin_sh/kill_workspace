NAME
   $EXECUTABLE - Kill all running clusters in the specified workspace

   specified workspace.

OPTIONS
   -workspace workspace_name
             Workspace name. If not specified, then kills the current workspace.

   -all
             Kills all running processes in each cluster. This options is passed on to each
