NAME
   ./$EXECUTABLE - Update and import PadoGrid provided dashboard templates

SYNOPSIS
   ./$EXECUTABLE [-readonly] [-label prometheus_label] [-?]

   -label prometheus_label
             The name of the Prometheus label to apply the cluster list filter. This
             label is typically introduced by Prometheus. For example, you can assign a
             list of target endpoints under the '$DEFAULT_LABEL' label as shown in the EXAMPLES
             section below. For Kubernetes, the 'namespace' label may be more approriate
             since all the members of a Hazelcast cluster start in the same namespace.
             Default: $DEFAULT_LABEL

   replaces the following folders in Grafana with the repective templates
   in the 'etc/dashboards' directory.
