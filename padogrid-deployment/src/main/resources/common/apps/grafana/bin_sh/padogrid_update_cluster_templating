NAME
   ./$EXECUTABLE - Update all folders provided by PadoGrid

SYNOPSIS
   ./$EXECUTABLE [-label prometheus_label] [-?]


DESCRIPTION
   Updates all folders included in PadoGrid by invoking 'update_cluster_templating'.
   This is a convenience command for updating the following folders provided by PadoGrid.

      - single: $SINGLE_FOLDERS
      - dual:   $DUAL_FOLDERS
      - all:    $ALL_FOLDERS

   -label prometheus_label
             The name of the Prometheus label to apply the cluster list filter. This
             label is typically introduced by Prometheus. For example, you can assign a
             list of target endpoints under the '$DEFAULT_LABEL' label as shown in the
             EXAMPLES section below. For Kubernetes, the 'namespace' label may be more
             approriate since all the members of a Hazelcast cluster start in the same
             namespace. Default: $DEFAULT_LABEL

   -editable
           If specified, then the dashboards are editable. Default: read-only

DEFAULT
   ./$EXECUTABLE -label $DEFAULT_LABEL
