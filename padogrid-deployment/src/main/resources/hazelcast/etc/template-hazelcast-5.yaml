#   padogrid depends on several system properties, which must be specified
#   in your hazelcast.xml. If you choose to use your own hazelcast.xml file then
#   make sure to include all system properties found in this file. The following
#   system properties are required:
#
#		"hazelcast-addon.cluster-name"
#		         Cluster name. Disabled by default.
#		         See below to see how to enable it.
#		"hazelcast-addon.management-center"
#		         MC URL.
#		"hazelcast-addon.tcp.port"
#		         TPC port number for the member.
#		"hazelcast-addon.tcp.members"
#		         A complete list of TCP member addresses.
