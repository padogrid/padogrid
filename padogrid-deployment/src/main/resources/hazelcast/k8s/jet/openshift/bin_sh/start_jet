NAME
   $EXECUTABLE - Start the Hazelcast Jet cluster configured by the 'build_app' script

SYNOPSIS
   $EXECUTABLE [-oss | -rhel] [-?]

DESCRIPTION
   Starts the Hazelcast Jet cluster configured by the 'build_app' script. If no options are specified then
   it automatically determines the environment based on the workspace setup. If JET_LICENSE_KEY is defined
   then it runs docker.io Hazelcast Jet Enterprise. To turn RHEL, specify the '-rhel' option. Note that if
   JET_LICENSE_KEY is not defined then it runs Hazelcast Jet OSS regardless of any options specified.

OPTIONS
   -oss
             If specified then starts Hazelcast Jet OSS. 

   -rhel
             If specified then launches the image downloaded from Hazelcast Jet Enterprise Red Hat. To use this
             option, you must first create an OpenShift secret for image pull. Please see the accompanied READE.md
             for details. If JET_LICENSE_KEY is not defined then this option is ignored and the '-oss' option
             is used instead.

DEFAULT:
   ./$EXECUTABLE
