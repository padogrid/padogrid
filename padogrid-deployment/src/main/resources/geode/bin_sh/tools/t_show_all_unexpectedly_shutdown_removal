NAME
   $EXECUTABLE - Find the members that unexpectedly shutdown for removal from the cluster

SYNOPSIS
   $EXECUTABLE [suspect_node] [-?]

DESCRIPTION
   Finds the members that unexpectedly shutdown for removal from the cluster. The found members
   have been removed from the cluster and they no longer participate in the cluster. These
   members may or may not be running. If they are running then it is possible that they
   might have formed a cluster of their own, creating a split-brain scenario.
