# Geode/GemFire PadoDesktop App

The `padodesktop` app provides scripts to run PadoDeskop for monitoring Pado clusters and executing PQL (Pado Query Language) and Geode/GemFire OQL (Object Query Language).

## Installing PadoDesktop App

PadoDesktop requires a Pado or PadoLite cluster. Pado and PadoLite can be installed by running the `install_padogrid` and `update_padogrid` commands.

```bash
# Pado
install_padogrid -product pado
update_padogrid -product pado 

# PadoLite
install_padogrid -product padolite
update_padogrid -product padolite
```

Similary, PadoDesktop can be installed using the `install_padgrod` and `update_padogrid` commands as follows.

```bash
install_padogrid -product padodesktop
update_padogrid -product padodesktop
```

The following commands create a Pado cluster and a PadoDesktop app.

```bash
create_cluster -cluster mypado -type pado
create_app -product geode -app padodesktop
```

## Running PadoDesktop App

The `bin_sh` directory contains the PadoDesktop scripts as follows.

```console
bin_sh/
├── clean
├── desktop
├── encryptor
├── pado_env.sh
└── setenv.sh
```

To start PadoDesktop:

```bash
cd_app padodesktop/bin_sh
./destop
```

From the login prompt, enter the Pado locator(s) and any user name. Password is not required. App ID should always be `sys` which allows full access to Pado/PadoLite.

Upon successful login, the desktop should display as shown below. If the desktop shows empty, then select the pull-down menu, **File/Open Template**, which will refresh the screen by displaying all the desktop components.

The `encryptor` command is for encrypting or decrypting text that may be added in the Pado client configuration files found in the `etc/` directory.

The desktop collects log and stats files in the `log/` and `stats` directories, respetively. The `clean` script empties these directories.

```bash
./clean
```
