# IndexMatrix page size. IndexMatrix breaks up the result set into pages. The client
# application receives only a single page that pertains to the current pagenation view.
# This allows the client to scroll the received (or local) page. When the client
# scrolls beyond the local page, IndxeMatrix automatically fetches the page that matches
# the scrolled view and replaces the current page. This enables IndexMatrix to send the
# first page to the client while building the rest of the pages, providing very quick
# responses to the client.
#
# For large result sets, increasing this value can provide better performance at the
# exenpense of the increased delay in receiving the first page. The smaller the value
# the faster the intial page will be received by the client, but the more load will
# be put on IndexMatrix for creating the larger number of smaller pages.
