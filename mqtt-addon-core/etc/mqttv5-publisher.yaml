# Define persistence class that persists messages for QoS 1 and 2.
persistence:
  # Persistence type. Specify the fully-qualified class name and
  # the constructor argument list. Paho provides the following
  # persistence classes:
  #
  #   MemoryPersistence, MqttDefaultFilePersistence
  #
  # MqttDefaultFilePersistence takes the 'path' property for the directory path
  # where the persistence data is to be stored. If the 'path' property is not
  # defined the working directory is used. All other properties are ignored.
  #
  # MemoryPersistence does not take properties. All properties are ignored.
  #
  # A custom persistence class must implement MqttClientPersistence and include
  # a constuctor with a single argument with the Properties type if the properties
  # are required. If such a constructor does not exist then the default no-arg
  # constructor is used to instantiate the class. In that case, the properties
  # are ignored. Unlike the Paho's builtin persistence classes described above,
  # a custom class requires the fully-quailifed class name. 
  #
  # Default:
  #   className: MqttDefaultFilePersistence
  #   properties:
  #     - key: path
  #       value: persist
  className: MqttDefaultFilePersistence
  properties:
    - key: path
