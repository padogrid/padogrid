# PadoGrid

The PadoGrid project aims to deliver a data grid platform with out-of-the-box turnkey solutions to many enterprise architecture use cases. The solutions come in the form of bundles which you simply *install and run*. See the PaodGrid manual and FAQ for details.

- [**PadoGrid Manual**](https://github.com/padogrid/padogrid/wiki)
- [**FAQ**](https://github.com/padogrid/padogrid/wiki/faq)

## Installation

You can install PadoGrid and the supported data grid products by running the interactive [**install_padogrid**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/padogrid/padogrid/develop/padogrid-deployment/src/main/resources/common/bin_sh/install_padogrid) script. Copy and paste the following command into your terminal.

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/padogrid/padogrid/develop/padogrid-deployment/src/main/resources/common/bin_sh/install_padogrid)"
```

:pencil2: *Note that `install_padogrid` is part of PadoGrid. Once PadoGrid is installed, you can run `install_padogrid` at any time to upgrade or downgrade products.*

[**Quick Start**](https://github.com/padogrid/padogrid/wiki/Quick-Start) provides detailed instructions. 

:pencil2: *The latest PadoGrid snapshot release is available if you cannot wait till the next release. It is automatically built whenver there are changes made in [RELEASE_NOTES.md](RELEASE_NOTES.md). You can download it from [Releases](https://github.com/padogrid/padogrid/releases) or using `install_padogrid`.*

## PadoGrid Brief

PadoGrid is a collection of add-on components and tools specifically designed for [data grid products](#data-Grid-Products) to deliver out-of-the-box, shrink-wrapped solutions. It introduces the concept of *distributed workspaces* for creating DevOps environments in which use cases can be quickly developed, tested, deployed and shared.

A workspace provides a sandbox environment completely isolated from other workspaces and can host a wide range of software components from a simple app to a highly complex ecosystem with many data grid clusters, apps, VMs, and Docker/Kubernetes containers. You can, for example, create a workspace that federates multiple data grid clusters serving inventory and sales data, a workspace that streams database CDC records via Kafka, a workspace that handles streamed data into the federated clusters via one or more Apache Spark or Hazelcast Jet clusters, and yet another workspace that integrates data analytics tools for performing AI/ML operations and creating reports. PadoGrid consolidates your workspaces into a single operations center.

  </a>
</p>

A workspace snapshot can be taken at any time in the form of a bundle that can be quickly deployed and run on another workspace created by another user on another platform. Because of their portability, bundles provide the means to shrink-wrap fully operational use cases. PadoGrid includes bundle catalogs from which you can search your use cases.

## Building `padogrid`

### Required Software

- Maven 3.x
- JDK 1.8+

### Building `padogrid` Distribution

There are a number of ways to build a PadoGrid distribution. For building a standard distribution release, run the `build_dist.sh` script as follows.

```bash
# Include all products and their man pages (standard distribution)
./build_dist.sh -all
```

You can also build distributions that are tailored to your needs as described in the following link.

[Building PadoGrid](https://github.com/padogrid/padogrid/wiki/Building-padogrid)

## Installing `padogrid` you have built

Released versions of PadoGrid are normally installed by running the `install_padogrid` command. For those that you have built, however, must be installed manually as describe in this section.

Upon successful build, the following distribution files will be generated.

```bash
padogrid-deployment/target/assembly/padogrid_<version>.tar.gz
padogrid-deployment/target/assembly/padogrid_<version>.zip
```

Inflate one of the distribution files in your file system. For example,

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Padogrid/products
tar -C ~/Padogrid/products/ -xzf padogrid_0.9.18-SNAPSHOT.tar.gz
cd ~/Padogrid/products
tree -L 1 padogrid_0.9.18-SNAPSHOT
```

**Output:**

```bash
padogrid_0.9.18-SNAPSHOT
├── LICENSE
├── NOTICE
├── README.md
├── RELEASE_NOTES.md
├── bin_sh
├── coherence
├── etc
├── geode
├── hadoop
├── hazelcast
├── kafka
├── lib
├── none
├── pods
├── redis
├── snappydata
└── spark
```

## Initializing PadoGrid

:pencil2: If you have run `install_padogrid`, then you have already initialized PadoGrid and you can skip this section.

To use PadoGrid, you must first create an RWE (Root Workspace Environment) by running the interactive command, `create_rwe`, to specify the workspaces directory and the product installation paths.

```bash
~/Padogrid/products/padogrid_0.9.18-SNAPSHOT/bin_sh/create_rwe
```

## Running PadoGrid using Docker and Podman

PadoGrid Docker containers follow the same version conventions as the build except for the SNAPSHOT versions which also include a build number starting from 1. For example, the `padogrid/paadogrid:0.9.18-SNAPSHOT-2` image has the build number 2. The SNAPSHOT versions are for testing only and subject to removal without notice.

```bash
# docker
docker run -it --rm padogrid/padogrid /bin/bash

# podman
podman run -it --rm padogrid/padogrid /bin/bash
```

If you are logged in the container and your container version is 0.9.9 and older, then you must intialize Padogrid as follows. Versions 0.9.10 and later do not require this step.

```bash
./padogrid_start -init
. ~/.bashrc
```

## Running PadoGrid in Kubernetes

You can run PadoGrid in Kubernetes as shown below. The PadoGird container stores workspaces in the `/opt/padogrid/workspaces` directory, which you can mount to a persistent volume as needed.

```bash
# kubectl
kubectl run padogrid --image=docker.io/padogrid/padogrid

# oc
oc run padogrid --image=docker.io/padogrid/padogrid
```

To login to the PadoGrid pod, make sure to specify the command, `bash`, as follows.

```bash
# kubectl
kubectl exec -it padogrid -- bash

# oc
oc exec -it padogrid -- bash
```

If you have a Hazelcast cluster running in the same namespace (project) as PadoGrid, then you can run the `perf_test` app as follows.

```bash
export NAMESPACE=<Kubernetes namespace/project>
export HAZELCAST_SERVICE=<Hazelcast Kubernetes service>
# Default cluster name is "dev".
export HAZELCAST_CLUSTER_NAME=<cluster name>
create_app
cd_app perf_test; cd bin_sh
./test_ingestion -run
```

To delete the PadoGrid pod:

```bash
# kubectl
kubectl delete pod paodgrid

# oc
oc delete pod padogrid
```

You may encounter a random userid assigned by Kubernetes and OpenShift instead of the required fixed userid, **padogrid**, especially when you deploy the PadoGrid container. The following link provides further details on running PadoGrid with the fixed userid when deployed in OpenShift.

[Deploying PadoGrid in OpenShift](https://github.com/padogrid/padogrid/wiki/Kubernetes#deploying-padogrid-in-openshift)

## Data Grid Products

PadoGrid natively supports the following data grid and analytics products.
